# Project Summary

The idea of my website is to present myself to the future employee, colleagues or customers. Website suppose to change my ordinary CV. I hope to have my portfolio on the website as well, to make it more valuable and informative. 

My experience of creating a website was exiting. It was my first steps to IT world and it was better than I expected. I was surprised how much work need to do to make things work but I was even more surprised that I can do it myself. It works like a magic for me - it's unbelievable how the codes from letters and signs can create something visual. I was very into this project and every little solved problem made me really proud of myself. 

I could write a long list of what could be improved on the website because it doesn't look like I expected in the beginning. This is because then I was making my Project Plan I didn't know what I am able to create. I wanted to make scrolling smooth, to do my CV section more hidden - not all the information in an one page. I wanted also include an interaction on my home page. Now I know, that many things I wanted to do on my website requires more knowledge of other languages.
What could be improved with my existing knowledge - a responsive design, than every page should work on different screen sizes. Also I could make a hidden Menu.

It was surprising then I calculated the hours I worked on a project. It was exactly 30 hours as planed. I think it was because I planed every hour witch I am going to spend on the project. I didn't work out the exact hours on exact page because I ran into the problems I didn't expect and some of the things I sorted out faster than I planed.
